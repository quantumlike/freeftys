freefyts code salvaged from google code   \

hi all.. i've salvaged the code from https://code.google.com/archive/p/freesftys-project/ as i wanted to use the notepadd++ plugins   \

NppDetectEncoding  \
NppDynamicFonts  \
NppHorizontalRuler  \
NppJpSelectAreaCustomize  \
NppYEtc  \
NppYUniUtil  \


the orginal all appears to be in japanese   \
http://freesftys.lv9.org/app/npp/   \


The plugin .dll zip file of NppYUniUtil plugin, https://github.com/quantumlike/freeftys/blob/master/secondary/NppYUniUtil/NppYUniUtil.dll is downloaded from http://freesftys.lv9.org/app/npp/soft/NppYUniUtil-0.1.18.zip .   \
It is put under https://github.com/quantumlike/freeftys/tree/master/secondary/NppYUniUtil .  \
It is Notepad++ plugins from freesftys@gmail.com.   \
It is created by freesftys@gmail.com on http://freesftys.lv9.org/app/npp/ .   \
It needs to create a folder “NppYUniUtil” under C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\plugins and put NppYUniUtil.dll in the new folder to make it work.

The plugin .dll file of Notepad++ Horizontal Ruler is downloaded from https://github.com/jmgrossma/freeftys/blob/master/secondary/NppHorizontalRuler/NppHorizontalRuler.dll?raw=true.  \
It is put under https://github.com/quantumlike/NppHorizontalRuler or https://github.com/quantumlike/freeftys/tree/master/secondary/NppHorizontalRuler.  \
A person made it avaialble on https://pixelatedbigfoot.wordpress.com/2015/09/02/notepad-horizontal-ruler-plugin/ . 
It needs to create a folder “NppHorizontalRuler” under C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\plugins and put NppHorizontalRuler.dll in the new folder to make it work.
